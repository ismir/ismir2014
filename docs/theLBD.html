			<p>ISMIR2014 will hold present two consecutive special sessions ---Late-Breaking / Demo (LBD) and unconference--- in the afternoon of the last conference day (Friday). The LDB session is dedicated to the presentation of preliminary result, ideas, applications or system prototypes that are not yet fully formed nor systematically evaluated, but of interest to the MIR community. Additionally, ISMIR2014 will continue the recent trend of hosting an informal group discussion and brainstorming event, known as an "unconference," which offers the unique opportunity to foster engaging conversations and interactions among participants across a wide range of seniority and experience.</p>
			<p><strong>Call for Late-Breaking / Demo Submissions</strong></p>
			Authors are encouraged to submit extended abstracts of one page (preferred) or two pages (maximum) to the LDB session. 
			Submissions must clearly state if there is to be a demonstration component, and briefly address any special requirements; 
			be aware that all LBD presentations will be posters. Formatting must comply with that of regular papers, 
			available at the <a href="Submissions.html">ISMIR2014 submission guidelines</a>, 
			and submissions do not need to be anonymous. We will operate on a <b>&ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo;</b> policy and screen submissions for formatting compliance. 
			Submissions that do not conform to the required format will be rejected. A maximum of thirty (30) works will be accepted, and 
			therefore interested researchers should be prepared to submit work as early as possible. The LBD submission portal will be made available at
			<a href="https://www.softconf.com/f/ismir2014-lbd/">https://www.softconf.com/f/ismir2014-lbd/</a> on <b>July 1st, 2014</b>. Acceptance/rejection notifications 
			will be sent to authors as submissions are screened. Note that at least one author of an accepted LBD abstract should present the poster at the session.
			
			<p><h4>ISMIR Unconference</h4></p>
			<p>Building upon the experience of the last two ISMIRs, the unconference organization will occur in three primary stages. First, as in years past, potential topics will be discussed beforehand by interested individuals through a 
			wiki or collaborative forum. This platform will be announced to the ISMIR Community following acceptance notifications of regular papers, and remain active through the 
			conference. At the start of the ISMIR2014, previous discussion will be distilled into an unconference &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; , a collaborative, online document allowing conference attendees to add, up-vote and modify topics as 
			desired. The final schedule will only be assembled at the start of the unconference event, at which point participants can volunteer to facilitate group discussion of a 
			given topic; priority will be given to topics on the blueprint before proceeding to the last minute ideas. Additional information, such as informal guidelines for facilitators, will be 
			made available before the start of the conference.

			</p>
			<p>
			ISMIR attendees who would like to join the unconference session will be assembled in the Auditorium room at 15:30, Friday October 31st. In the beginning, a plenary session will take place for announcement and last minute event calls. 
			An event "facilitator" will be named as being responsible for enabling and steering discussion during the session. 
			Then, the unconference guidelines will be quickly summarized and the events will start. 
			</p>
			<p>The venue will have five meeting rooms for unconference, each can accommodate 20-30 attendees, and three of them are equipped with projectors. We will hold 5 events in parallel. Each event will be scheduled 30 minutes long, and 10 minutes break. 
			The tentative schedule is as follows:
			<ul>
				<li> 15:30 - 16:00		Unconference Plenary (Auditorium)
				<li> 16:00 - 16:10		Break
				<li> 16:10 - 16:40		Event-1 (Meeting Room 1 - 5)
				<li> 16:40 - 16:50		Break
				<li> 16:50 - 17:20		Event-2 (Meeting Room 1 - 5)
				<li> 17:20 - 17:30		Break
				<li> 17:30 - 18:00		Event-3 (Meeting Room 1 - 5)
			</ul></p>
