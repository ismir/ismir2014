            	<li> Each day, a different selection of posters will be hung in specific spaces at the venue for *the whole day*. Your particular space will be communicated to you in due time. On the specific day of display of your poster, you are expected to be near your poster at least during two time slots, when coffee is served -- between 10:50AM-12:00AM and between 3:30PM-4:30PM.

            	<li> According to the size of the poster stand, we prefer posters of size similar to <b>width = 120cm and height = 150cm</b>, in either Portrait or Landscape format (A0 would be too small).

						  between 10:20AM-10:50AM. On the specific day of your poster presentation, you will have exactly <b>one minute</b> and <b>one-page slide</b> (time will be controlled by the session chair) to introduce your poster and "tease" the audience, inviting them to a more personal scientific discussion later around your poster.
